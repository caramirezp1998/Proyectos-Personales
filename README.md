# Latent Dirchlet Association Model Applied to a Colombian news website during Coronavirus Pandemic

I thought of this project a while back before the pandemic arrived. I had just recently learn some natural language processing algorithms and 
I wanted to apply them on a dataset that felt more close to me, since all the text open source data available are not very related to my home country (Colombia). Thats when I 
started to plan and organize this project, that would take me on a long road of learning to apply with all the difficulties that this may bring. Therefore, I decided to divide
the project into 4 parts:

- Web Scraping for Data
- Text Processing 
- Creating the Model
-  Creating the Web App 

If you have a particular interest for any of the parts of the proyect you can check them out in the folders specify for them.You can also check the web app in the following
