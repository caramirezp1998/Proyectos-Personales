# Latent Dirchlet Association Model Applied to a Colombian news website during Coronavirus Pandemic

I thought of this project a while back before the pandemic arrived. I had just recently learn some natural language processing algorithms and 
I wanted to apply them on a dataset that felt more close to me, since all the text open source data available are not very related to my home country (Colombia). Thats when I 
started to plan and organize this project, that would took me on a long road of learning to apply with all the difficulties that this may have brought.

The aim of this project is to collect and process the text news data from the [El Tiempo](www.eltiempo.com) news website, create a unsupervised model to find hidden patterns in their content using a bag of words methodology to try to classify the articles into a different number of topics and finally create a dashboard that can help us to visualize the results of this model in a way that we can find some insights in it. 

Taking this into account, I decided to divide the project into 4 parts:

- Web Scraping for Data
- Text Processing 
- Creating the Model
-  Creating the Web App 

If you have a particular interest for any of the parts of the project you can check them out in the folders specify for them and if you have a comment about something let me know at my email: ca.ramirezp98@gmail.com
